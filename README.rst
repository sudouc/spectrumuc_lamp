SpectrumUC Lamp

Python module to listen to a Firebase instance, and 
issue commands based on the color value of the node.

Possible expansion to this module would controlling LED's rather than just
issuing shell commands, and providing some form of CLI to manually control the node
and/or edit the configuration file

This is designed to run on top of OLA: https://www.openlighting.org/
